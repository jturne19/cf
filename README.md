## Scripts

| Name                 | Location  | Description |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------|
|`utils.py`			   |`utils`    | contains all the functions/utilities 		             |					 
|`catalog_setup.py`	   |`workflow` | calling the functions for creating ds9 region files for everything and other 'setup' type things   |
|`sc_gmc_sep.py`	   |`workflow` | calling the functions for finding the star cluster - gmc nearest neighbors and making histograms   |
|`sc_gmc_assoc.py`	   |`workflow` | calling the functions for associating star clusters with gmcs 									    |
|`tpcf.py`	 		   |`workflow` | doing the two-point correlation function 															|
|`cf.py`	 		   |`workflow` | cross-correlation between SCs and GMCs 															|


### process notes
- generate ds9 region files for all the GMCs using `all_galaxies_gmc_region_files`
- generate ds9 region files for all the star clusters using `all_galaxies_clust_region_files`
- generate ds9 region files for the HST footprints using FLC files with `all_galaxies_flc_region_files`
- manually made HST full footprint ds9 region files since i couldn't think of a way to do this automatically
- combined the NGC0628C and NGC0628E cluster catalogs to make NGC0628. already have HST maps combined so this makes sense
- generate the outline plots which overlay the GMC ellipses with the star cluster positions and HST footprints with `all_galaxies_outline_plots`
- generate masks which define the overlap of the HST and ALMA footprints with `generate_overlap_mask`. need to use uwpa with more memory for the larger hst images (628, 3351, 3627)
- find star cluster - gmc nearest neighbors and makes histograms split at 10 Myr in `sc_gmc_sep.py`
	- also outputs csv files with all the star clusters in the overlap masks and their props + nearest neighbor info which can be read in as pandas dataframes
	- and one for the GMCs in the HST-ALMA footprint overlap mask
- generate another dataframe/csv for each galaxy with the associated GMC + props for the star clusters in `sc_gmc_assoc.py`
	- also produces histogram of star cluster ages for (i) within 1 Rgmc (ii) b/w 1 and 2 Rgmc (iii) b/w 2 and 3 Rgmc (iv) unassociated
	- also make a 'mega' dataframe with all the galaxies together to allow the creation of histograms for each enivronmental location: center, bar, interarm, spiral arm, disk
- generate the two-point correlation functions for all the galaxies and make the plots in `tpcf.py`  
- generate the cross-correlation functions for all the galaxies and make plots in `cf.py`
